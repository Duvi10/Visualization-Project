## by Duveshan Chetty


## Prosper Loan Data

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> I have noticed that the "middle class" are more likely to take out a loan, this correlates with Employed people also being the most frequent customers.

>I Have observed that The people earning between 1-25000 have the highest interest rates which makes sense as their risk is higher than the other higher earning categories.

>I have also noticed that theres a relationship between Loans that went into arrears and the interest rate. The higher the interest rate, the higher the chance of the loanee defaulting or going into arrears.

>I have noticed that Income Range is a minor factor contributing to Borrowing APR and the major factor is the customers Prosper Rating .
